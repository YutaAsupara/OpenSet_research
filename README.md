# OpenSetRecognitionをやりたい動機

　Scheirerらの[1]では
> —To date, almost all experimental evaluations of machine learning based recognition algorithms in computer vision have taken the form of “closed set” recognition, whereby all testing classes are known at training time. A more realistic scenario for vision applications is “open set” recognition, in which incomplete knowledge of the world is present at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing.
